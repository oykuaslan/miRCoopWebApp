miRCoop
===================================

`miRCoop https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9311836`, is a method that finds potentially synergistic pairs through kernel interaction tests on matched gene expression levels of mRNAs and miRNAs. Now, we present an updated miRCoop pipeline, miRCoop v2, a faster version with a 30 speed up in runtime, which allowed us to apply it on 31 different TCGA cancers .

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
