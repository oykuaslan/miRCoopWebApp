miRCoop
===================================

`miRCoop https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9311836`, is a method that finds potentially synergistic pairs through kernel interaction tests on matched gene expression levels of mRNAs and miRNAs. Now, we present an updated miRCoop pipeline, miRCoop v2, a faster version with a 30 speed up in runtime, which allowed us to apply it on 31 different TCGA cancers. The candidate cancer triplets, the synergistic miRNA pairs and their common targets,  are presented in 'miRCoop web application http://mircoop.sabanciuniv.edu' to make our results available to the public.

how to :ref:`installation` the project.
