Cancer Specific Analysis
========
Predicted triplets can be investigated here. First, one of the 31 different cancer types included in the study is selected from the cancer type section. After the 'cancer type' is selected in the left panel, the miRCoop triplets and synergistic miRNA pairs identified for that cancer are presented to the user in the main panel.
