There can be three different modes of regulation in synergistic miRNA relationships with transcription factors.These situations can be:two miRNAs can regulate expression of a common gene by binding to two different TFs, one miRNA directly regulates the gene, while the second miRNA can bind to the TF and two miRNAs can bind to a single TF, regulating the expression of the gene.


Step 1: Identification of Candidate miRNA - mRNA Interactions
