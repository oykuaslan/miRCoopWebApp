    <p> <font color="#000000" face="verdana" size="3">  miRCoop is a large scale web server for predicted synergistic miRNA pairs. miRCoop uses kernel-based statistical interaction tests, together with miRNA and mRNA target information. We apply our approach to patient data of 31 different TCGA cancer types. We believe miRCoop can aid our understanding of the complex regulatory interactions in different health and disease states of the cell and can help in designing miRNA-based therapies.  </p>
